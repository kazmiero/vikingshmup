# Viking Shmup

This project is my first attempt to program a video game. It is a little *shoot them up* (or *shmup*) developped with C++/SDL2.

## How to compile

The project has only been tested on linux, so has the Makefile.
You'll need to install SDL2 development files on your distribution.
When you have cloned the repository, do `make setup` to create all needed subidrectories. Then `make` should work.
